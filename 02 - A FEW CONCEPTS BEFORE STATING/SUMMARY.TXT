02 - A FEW CONCEPTS BEFORE STATING
    This chapter will be decribed:
        1 - The "assign" operator.
        2 - How to manage objects in memory.
        3 - How to use the on-line help

0201 - HOW R WORKS
    >> R is an interpreted language, not a compiled one, meaning that all commands typed on the keyboard are directly executated  [...]
    >> In R, a function ALWAYS needs to be written with parentheses, even if there's nothing within them. If you type a function without parentheses, R will display the content of the function.
    >>>> In R prompt type "write" function without parentheses, the return will be: 
        
        ...
        > write
        function (x, file = "data", ncolumns = if (is.character(x)) 1 else 5, 
            append = FALSE, sep = " ") 
        cat(x, file = file, sep = c(rep.int(sep, ncolumns - 1), "\n"), 
            append = append)
        <bytecode: 0x0000024f787b3a20>
        <environment: namespace:base>
        ...
        
    >> When R is running, variables, data, functions, results, etc, are stored in the active memory of the computer in the form objects which have a name. The user can do actions on these objects with operators (arithmetic, logical comparisons, ...) and functions (which are themselves objects)
